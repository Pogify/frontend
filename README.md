> ### üöß‚õî Pogify is still in its infancy and undergoing rapid development. It is **NOT** production ready. Do **NOT** expect it to work to any capacity. ‚õîüöß

> ### ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó Important Notice: Pogify does **NOT** stream audio of the host of a listening session. ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

## Features

- A single host can control the playback of an almost unlimited audience.
- A host an use any Spotify client for their own listening.
- When the host plays, pauses, seeks, or skips a track, the listeners' Spotify player will do the same.
- (Planned Feature) Twitch streamers can create permanent session links.

## Mechanism

Pogify does **NOT** stream audio from the host of a listening session. Instead, Pogify collects metadata from the host (ex. current song, current timestamp in the song, etc.) and broadcasts it to their entire audience. 

## Known Issues / Limitations
